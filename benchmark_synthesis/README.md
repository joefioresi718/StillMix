# StillMix
This is our implementation of OOD benchmark synthesis. 


## Preparing foreground masks and background images
Please refer to Section S2 of the Supplementary Material for the details of foreground masks and background images.



## Results
We release SCUBA and ConflFG on [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21AH8Ach9qjnQQh4Q&id=C88D845F827102A9%21111362&cid=C88D845F827102A9). Since SCUFO is randomly sampled from SCUBA, we do not release SCUFO due to the limited storage space. Our experiments show that constructing SCOFO by sampling SCUBA with different random seeds only leads to slight performance difference (<1.0%) on SCUFO.

We provide the dataset splits used in our paper on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H2_rfwImw6HtUd2PfiASInAy9WylnkSQ?usp=drive_link).
